<h1>The importance of education</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size: 30px; ">
It assists people in becoming better citizens, obtaining a higher-paying career, and demonstrating the distinction between good and wrong. Education teaches us the value of hard work while also assisting us in our growth and development. As a result, by understanding and respecting rights, rules, and regulations, we may help to form a better society to live in.</p>
